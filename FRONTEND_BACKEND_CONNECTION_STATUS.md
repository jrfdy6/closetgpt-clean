# 🚀 Frontend-Backend Connection Status

## ✅ Current Status: CONNECTED

Your frontend is now properly connected to your deployed backend at:
`https://acceptable-wisdom-production-ac06.up.railway.app`

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated API Configuration
- ✅ Updated `shared/api/endpoints.ts` to use correct backend URL
- ✅ Updated `frontend/src/config.ts` to use correct backend URL
- ✅ Fixed environment variables in `.env.local`

### 2. Created Proper API Routes
- ✅ Created `/api/outfits/generate/route.ts` for outfit generation
- ✅ Created `/api/wardrobe/route.ts` for wardrobe management
- ✅ Updated `/api/outfits/route.ts` to provide helpful error messages

### 3. Backend Endpoint Mapping
Your backend has these available endpoints:
- ✅ `/health` - Health check
- ✅ `/api/test` - API test
- ✅ `/api/wardrobe` - Wardrobe management (requires auth)
- ✅ `/api/wardrobe/{item_id}` - Individual wardrobe items (requires auth)
